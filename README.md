# Hangman

A simple word guessing game written in HTML and JavaScript.

## Introduction

Hangman is a fun word guessing game where you need to guess the hidden word one letter at a time. You have a limited number of lives, and you win by correctly guessing the word before running out of lives.

## How to Play

1. Open the game in your browser.
2. You start with 3 lives.
3. You will see a series of dashes that represent the hidden word.
4. Press any letter key (a-z) on your keyboard to guess a letter.
5. If the letter is in the word, it will replace the dashes.
6. If the letter is not in the word, you will lose a life.
7. Continue guessing letters until you either win by revealing the whole word or lose all your lives.
8. If you win, the background turns green, and you'll see a "You Won!" message.
9. If you lose, the background turns red, and you'll see a "You Lost!" message.
